Documentation : Lazersquid
by Gabrielle Bennett

Changes from original design: 

I didn't add in the multiple types of lazers : I simply didn't have enough time.
Also, the game is not side-scrolling but top-to-bottom scrolling. It fits better with my animations 
and cohesiveness/ease of viewing. 

Requirements: 

Sound: 
	I have background music, shooting effects, movement effects, and sound feedback for when an enemy is killed.
	Extra:  There are multiple background sounds (advance far enough to hear them -levels 3 and 8).
	
Images: 
	Consistent style : I made everything myself, including the animated bits. They're all pixel art.
Drawing: everything is canvas.

Interaction
	Player controls Harmon the cuttlefish with arrow keys and spacebar. 
	
Game Screens: 
	Well, I only have 3: playing, pause, and gameover. No instructions (I forgot).

	Visible score and states. 
	
	Difficulty: game begins easy, then enemies get faster and greater in number. 
	
Game design requirements: 
	Sprite behavior: I worked waaay too much on this, and spent a lot of time getting the 
	animation and animation states just right. It feels fun to navigate in general.
	
	Player choices matter, especially in later levels. It's faster to move upwards than anything,
	which adds a unique gameplay element. I think it's really fun.
	
OOP / Coding standards: 
	Everything is commented and in the requested module format. 
	No errors. Use strict utilized. 
	Use object literals especially for bullets, etc. 
	Commented.
